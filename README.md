Blockbench typescript types!

Originally by JannisX11, this repo will follow the development of the [Plugins API](https://github.com/MaxTheMooshroom/bb-plugin-api).

The types here will not be types defined in the Plugins API, but rather continued completion of the mappings as
the need arises during development on the Plugins API.
